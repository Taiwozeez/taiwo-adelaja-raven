Raven Assessment Feedback

Thank you for the opportunity to take the assessment for the Frontend Developer role. I appreciate the chance to demonstrate my skills through this practical task.

I approached the assessment by setting up a development environment using React with Vite, which I chose for its fast compilation and development speed. In building the application, I followed the requirements closely, utilizing HTML, CSS, and React. For the charting functionality, I integrated the Recharts library, which provided the necessary visualization features. I initially considered using shadcn/ui, but opted against it since it's more tailored for TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, which were not part of the instructions.

Responsiveness

To ensure a responsive user experience, I implemented mobile-first design principles using CSS media queries. I also added a drawer component for the payment section to improve usability on smaller screens. Overall, I made sure all views were mobile-friendly and adaptable to different screen sizes.

API Integration

Due to the limited time, I wasn't able to fully complete the API integration. One of the challenges I faced was the lack of sufficient or well-documented API endpoints, which consumed a significant amount of time. Despite that, I managed to begin the implementation. While it requires some debugging and refinement, I believe with additional time, I could have completed it as intended.

Overall, I found the assessment focused on building a cryptocurrency-related website, both engaging and insightful. It was a great opportunity to apply my frontend development skills in this test, and I enjoyed working on it.
